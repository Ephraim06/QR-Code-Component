## My process

I started with the HTML Boilerplate, then added bootstrap to use the bootstrap card. Once done, I create sections of the page, to manipulate the HTML elements with CSS to achieve the result.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Bootstrap cards, and Mobile First workflow.

### Continued development

Building Responsive websites, and mostly focusing on Mobile First workflow.
